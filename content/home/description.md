The GYSELA-X code is a 5D full-f and flux-driven gyrokinetic code.
It has been developed at CEA (http://irfm.cea.fr/) in collaboration with several partners (INRIA, University of Strasbourg, University of Nancy, IPP Garching, â€¦).

From the numerical point of view, GYSELA-X is based on a semi-Lagrangian scheme, hence its name: GYSELA is an acronym for GYrokinetic SEmi-LAgrangian.
