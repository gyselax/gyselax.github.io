Abdelhadi is a research engineer at IRFM. He is interested in applied mathematics, particularly the numerical implementation of solvers in an HPC context. He focuses on methods specific to solving differential equations. On the other hand, having a keen interest in geometry, he is developing a specific mesher, aligned with magnetic field lines, which will be part of the Gysela-X++ toolchain.
