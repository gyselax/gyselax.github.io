Philipp Krah is a computational physicist with expertise in surrogate modeling, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing. He earned a PhD in applied mathematics at TU Berlin, where he developed data-driven reduced-order models for transport-dominated fluid systems using nonlinear reduction methods and wavelet techniques.
His research focuses on embedding physical structure into data-driven approaches to accelerate simulations. He has published in leading mathematical and physical journals and contributed to several open-source HPC projects, including WABBIT (Fortran, OpenMPI), CMM-turbulence (C++, CUDA), and GyselaX++ (C++, Kokkos). His current work in GyselaX++ addresses non-axisymmetric gyrokinetic plasma simulations for stellarators and the integration of AI-based diagnostics and reduced-order models inside GyselaX++ within the NumPEx Exa-DoST program.
