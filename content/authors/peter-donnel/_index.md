Dr. Peter Donnel did his studies in the physics department of ENS Paris. He then did a PhD at CEA Cadarache (2015-2018) using GYSELA to study impurity transport. After a two years postdoc at the Swiss Plasma center, he joined again the GYSELA team in 2021. He works mainly on the development of the GYSELA code and its usage to study transport in tokamak plasmas.
