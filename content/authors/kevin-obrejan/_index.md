Dr. Kevin Obrejan is a research engineer at the Institute for Magnetic Fusion Research (IRFM) of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). During his PhD at Kyoto University (Japan), he developed the first version of the global full-f gyrokinetic code GKNET. After a post-doc at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), he joined IRFM in 2020 where he now holds a permanent position. His activities center around the development, HPC optimisation and physics validation of several large parallel simulation codes related to fusion plasma (mainly Gysela, JOREK, Soledge-3X).
