Emily Bourne has been working as a research software engineer at the EUROfusion Advanced Computing Hub at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) since the start of 2023.
Her PhD entitled "Non-Uniform Numerical Schemes for the Modelling of Turbulence in the 5D GYSELA Code" was awarded by Aix-Marseille University (2022).
She additionally holds degrees in Physics, Computational Science and Engineering.
In her current job she works with a variety of HPC paradigms including OpenACC, OpenMP offload, and Kokkos to accelerate plasma physics codes including GyselaX++.
In her free time she is the lead developer of the open-source Pyccel project which aims to help researchers move more easily from prototyped code in Python to HPC code in low-level languages.
