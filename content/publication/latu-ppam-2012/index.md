abstract: 'Modeling turbulent transport is a major goal in order to predict confinement
  issues in a tokamak plasma. The gyrokinetic framework considers a computational
  domain in five dimensions to look at kinetic issues in a plasma. Gyrokinetic simulations
  lead to huge computational needs. Up to now, the gyrokinetic code GYSELA performed
  large simulations using a few thousands of cores. The work proposed here improves
  GYSELA onto two points: memory scalability and execution time. The new solution
  allows the GYSELA code to scale well up to 64k cores.'
