abstract: Two-dimensional fluid simulations of scrape-off layer (SOL) turbulence with
  non-constrained energy content (flux driven) are characterized by profile relaxation
  and strong outward bursts of density. The ballistic propagation extends well beyond
  the e-folding length of the SOL with a Mach number of M~0.04. Turbulence stabilization
  is achieved by biasing part of the limiter surface. The critical radial extent to
  achieve this stabilization is derived. This effect governs the size of the biased
  ring required to insulate the wall from long range bursts of matter. The same characteristic
  scale also governs the critical size of Langmuir probe tips. For probe tips in excess
  of this size, the flux tube to the probe is found to be decoupled from the background
  plasma.
