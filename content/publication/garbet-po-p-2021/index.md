abstract: "A model of E \xD7 B staircases is proposed based on a wave kinetic equation\
  \ coupled to poloidal momentum equation. staircase pattern idealized as periodic\

  \ avalanches. Wave packets are trapped in flow due refraction. In this model, an\
  \ motif emerges the interaction between (avalanches) and waves presence instability\

  \ spectrum growth rate drift waves. The velocity profile found peak near its maxima\
  \ flatten minima. optimum configuration for formation rate, is, maximum at zero\
  \ number. mean responsible preferential propagation speed It not mandatory condition\
