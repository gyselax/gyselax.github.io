abstract: "Abstract Impurity transport is numerically investigated for different types\
  \ of impurity, such as helium (He), argon (Ar), and tungsten (W). Both turbulent\
  \ neoclassical transports are treated self-consistently using the full- f gyrokinetic\
  \ software GYSELA. For a light impurity mainly controlled by turbulence, while found\
  \ to be dominant in case heavy The impact poloidal asymmetry density also studied\
  \ detail it strong high charge due its Boltzmann-type response. Such might lead\
  \ core accumulation impurities reducing thermal screening factor transport. two\
  \ main contributions transport\u2014Pfirsch\u2013Schl\xFCter (PS) flux banana\u2013\
  plateau (BP) flux\u2014are studied. Depending on their mass ( A ) Z ), magnitudes\
  \ each determined accordingly. Tungsten shows PS compared other impurities, BP argon.\
  \ An analytical model including effect with numerical simulation good agreement\
  \ between them."
