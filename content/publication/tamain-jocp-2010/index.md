abstract: 'We present a new code aiming at giving a global and coherent approach for
  transport and turbulence issues in the edge plasma of Tokamaks. The TOKAM-3D code
  solves 3D fluid drift equations in full-torus geometry including both closed field
  lines and SOL physics. No scale separation is assumed so that interactions between
  large scale flows and turbulence are coherently treated. Moreover, the code can
  be run in transport regimes ranging from purely anomalous diffusion to fully established
  turbulence. Specific numerical schemes have been developed which can solve the model
  equations whether the presence of a limiter in the plasma is taken into account
  or not. Example cases giving an overview of the field of application of the code
  as well as verification results are also presented. '
