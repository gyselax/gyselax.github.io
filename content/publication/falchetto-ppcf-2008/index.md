abstract: A cross-comparison and verification of state-of-the-art European codes describing
  gradient-driven plasma turbulence in the core and edge regions of tokamaks, carried
  out within the EFDA Task Force on Integrated Tokamak Modelling, is presented. In
  the case of core ion temperature gradient (ITG) driven turbulence with adiabatic
  electrons (neglecting trapped particles), good/reasonable agreement is found between
  various gyrokinetic/gyrofluid codes. The main physical reasons for some deviations
  observed in nonlocal simulations are discussed. The edge simulations agree very
  well on collisionality scaling and acceptably well on beta scaling (below the MHD
  boundary) for cold-ion cases, also in terms of the non-linear mode structure.
