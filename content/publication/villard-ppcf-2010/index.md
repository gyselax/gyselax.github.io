abstract: 'Important steps towards the understanding of turbulent transport have been
  made with the development of the gyrokinetic framework for describing turbulence
  and with the emergence of numerical codes able to solve the set of gyrokinetic equations.
  This paper presents some of the main recent advances in gyrokinetic theory and computing
  of turbulence. Solving 5D gyrokinetic equations for each species requires state-of-the-art
  high performance computing techniques involving massively parallel computers and
  parallel scalable algorithms. The various numerical schemes that have been explored
  until now, Lagrangian, Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian, each have their advantages
  and drawbacks. A past controversy regarding the finite size effect (finite ρ* )
  in ITG turbulence has now been resolved. It has triggered an intensive benchmarking
  effort and careful examination of the convergence properties of the different numerical
  approaches. Now, both Eulerian and Lagrangian global codes are shown to agree and
  to converge to the flux-tube result in the ρ*->0 limit. It is found, however, that
  an appropriate treatment of geometrical terms is necessary: inconsistent approximations
  that are sometimes used can lead to important discrepancies. Turbulent processes
  are characterized by a chaotic behaviour, often accompanied by bursts and avalanches.
  Performing ensemble averages of statistically independent simulations, starting
  from different initial conditions, is presented as a way to assess the intrinsic
  variability of turbulent fluxes and obtain reliable estimates of the standard deviation.
  Further developments concerning non-adiabatic electron dynamics around mode-rational
  surfaces and electromagnetic effects are discussed.'
