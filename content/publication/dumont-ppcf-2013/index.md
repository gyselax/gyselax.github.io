abstract: Evidence for the impact of energetic particles (EPs) on turbulence is given
  in this paper. Firstly, the excitation of electrostatic instabilities in linear
  gyrokinetic simulations performed with the global GYSELA code by introducing distribution
  functions typical of fast ions in tokamak plasmas is presented. The obtained mode
  is unambiguously characterized as an EGAM, i.e. a geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) excited
  by EPs. The influence of EGAMs on turbulence and associated transport is then analyzed
  by implementing a source adapted to the inclusion of fast particle populations in
  non-linear simulations. This source successfully excites EGAMs in the presence of
  turbulence, which leads to a drastic reduction of the turbulent transport. However,
  this reduction is only transient; it is followed by an increase of the turbulent
  activity, characterized by a complex interaction between the EGAMs and the turbulence.
  In the subsequent steady-state regime, turbulent transport appears to be modulated
  at the EGAM frequency.
