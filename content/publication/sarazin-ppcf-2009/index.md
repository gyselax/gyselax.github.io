abstract: A novel method is proposed to construct collisionless fluid closures accounting
  for some kinetic properties. The idea consists in optimizing the agreement between
  the fluid and kinetic quasi-linear entropy production rates, so as to constrain
  the closure coefficients. This procedure is applied to the slab branch of the ion
  temperature gradient driven instability. Focusing on the kinetic regime characterized
  by slow waves, the closure proposed by Hammett and Perkins (Hammett and Perkins
  1990 Phys. Rev. Lett. 64 3019) naturally emerges from the systematic identification
  of the kinetic and fluid entropy production rates. This closure is revealed to be
  extremely powerful well beyond the kinetic regime. Besides, it reconciles the fluid
  and kinetic linear stability diagrams in the two-dimensional space of the density
  and temperature gradient lengths. Such a method is systematic and generic. As such,
  it is applicable to other models and classes of instabilities.
