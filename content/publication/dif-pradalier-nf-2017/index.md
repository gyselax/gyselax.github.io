abstract: 'We show that a class of near-marginal and low-collisional magnetised plasmas
  naturally evolve into a globally organised state dubbed the â€˜ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/57/6/066026/nfaa6873ieqn003.gif]
  $퐄times 퐁$ staircaseâ€™. A key signature of this self-organised state is the containment
  of avalanche activity, detrimental for confinement, by a series of microbarriers
  for transport, the staircase steps, beneficial for confinement. Conditions for existence
  of the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/57/6/066026/nfaa6873ieqn004.gif]
  $퐄times 퐁$ staircase, impact on transport and confinement and robustness in parameter
  space are discussed.'
