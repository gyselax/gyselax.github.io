abstract: Abstract Poloidal flows and avalanches play a key role in tokamak plasma
  selforganization by suppressing turbulence sheared flow regions, contributing to
  the formation of weak transport barriers. These structures, predicted GYSELA simulations
  indirectly observed Tore Supra tokamak, are challenging detect due their millimeter-scale
  size. This study uses Ultra-Fast-Swept Reflectometer (UFSR), capable high spatial
  resolution signal-to-noise ratio, analyze characteristics, including flow-induced
  spectral asymmetries. &amp;#xD;The synthetic diagnostic FeDoT, developed for UFSR
  data interpretation, enables these structures using 2D wave propagation advanced
  signal processing routines. FeDoT demonstrate that coherence length, derived from
  reflectometer signals, closely aligns with radial structure electric field can be
  used staircases. Furthermore, asymmetry, indicative direction flows, is quantified
  novel chirality metric. findings validate use reflectometry detecting barriers,
  providing insights into interplay between transport.
