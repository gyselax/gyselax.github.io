abstract: We investigate the interplay between ion temperature gradient (ITG) and
  parallel velocity (PVG) instabilities in cylindrical geometry using a Water-bag
  model 5D gyrokinetic simulations with modified version of GYSELA code. The provides
  an analytical dispersion relation, which is compared to linear simulations. Strong
  agreement found predicted simulated growth rates real frequencies, validating GYSELA's
  applicability systems. comparison also highlights key parametric dependencies on
  instability thresholds, including effects density profiles, gradients, shear. Notably,
  weak gradients are stabilize PVG modes, whereas strong tend destabilize them. Additionally,
  flow shear shown enhance ITG-PVG hybrid modes. These properties likely impact turbulent
  regime.
