abstract: "The role of poloidal convective cells\u2014i.e. low frequency axisymmetric\
  \ modes the electric potential\u2014on transport processes is studied with full-F\
  \ gyrokinetic code GYSELA. In order to understand impact cells, we apply a numerical\
  \ filter cells and compare simulation results without filter. energy flux driven\
  \ by magnetic drifts (due curvature field lines gradient intensity \u2207B) turns\
  \ out be reduced factor about 2 once applied. A careful analysis reveals that spectrum\
  \ well-correlated turbulent Reynolds stress tensor, giving credit their turbulence\
  \ origin. on can interpreted as synergy between neoclassical dynamics."
