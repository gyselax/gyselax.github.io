abstract: 'In order to gain reliable predictions on turbulent fluxes in tokamak plasmas,
  physics based transport models are required. Nonlinear gyrokinetic electromagnetic
  simulations for all species are still too costly in terms of computing time. On
  the other hand, interestingly, the quasi-linear approximation seems to retain the
  relevant physics for fairly reproducing both experimental results and nonlinear
  gyrokinetic simulations. Quasi-linear fluxes are made of two parts: (1) the quasi-linear
  response of the transported quantities and (2) the saturated fluctuating electrostatic
  potential. The first one is shown to follow well nonlinear numerical predictions;
  the second one is based on both nonlinear simulations and turbulence measurements.
  The resulting quasi-linear fluxes computed by QuaLiKiz (Bourdelle et al 2007 Phys.
  Plasmas 14 112501) are shown to agree with the nonlinear predictions when varying
  various dimensionless parameters, such as the temperature gradients, the ion to
  electron temperature ratio, the dimensionless collisionality, the effective charge
  and ranging from ion temperature gradient to trapped electron modes turbulence.'
