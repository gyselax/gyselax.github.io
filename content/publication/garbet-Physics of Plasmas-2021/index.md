abstract: "A model of E \xD7 B staircases is proposed based on a wave kinetic equation\
  \ coupled to poloidal momentum equation. staircase pattern idealized as periodic\
  \ radial structure zonal shear layers that bound regions propagating packets, viewed\
  \ avalanches. Wave packets are trapped in flow due refraction. In this model, an\
  \ motif emerges the interaction between (avalanches) and waves presence instability\
  \ drive. Amplitude, shape, spatial period predicted functions background fluctuation\
  \ spectrum growth rate drift waves. The velocity profile found peak near its maxima\
  \ flatten minima. optimum configuration for formation rate, is, maximum at zero\
  \ number. mean responsible preferential propagation speed It not mandatory condition\
  \ existence solutions, but has impact their period."
