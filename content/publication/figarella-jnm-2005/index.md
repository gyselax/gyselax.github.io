abstract: 'Cross-field transport in the SOL influences tokamak performance in particular
  regarding the divertor efficiency. Recent experiment evidence emphasizes non-exponential
  and/or flat SOL profiles that suggest a large perpendicular transport. A 2D fluid
  model based on the interchange instability to simulate the SOL turbulence was found
  to exhibits intermittent dynamics of the particle flux. We propose a control method
  that prevents long range transport events from reaching the far SOL: It consists
  in biasing the far SOL leading to a transport barrier which stops the propagation
  of these intermittent events. The best trade off is to localize the biased toroidal
  ring around the baffles. We show that such a control is achievable providing the
  strength of the barrier is strong enough. The investigation of the minimal biasing
  power required to achieve the control as well as its experimental estimate is performed. '
