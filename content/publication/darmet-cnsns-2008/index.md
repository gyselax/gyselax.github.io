abstract: 'Flux driven kinetic transport is analysed for deeply trapped ion turbulence
  with the code GYSELA. The main observation is the existence of a steady state situation
  with respect to the statistics, in particular the balance between the injected energy
  and the time averaged energy flowing out through the outer edge boundary layer.
  The temperature is characterised by a very bursty behaviour with a skewed PDF. Superimposed
  to these short time scale fluctuations, one finds a regime with a strong increase
  of the zonal flows and a quenching of the turbulent energy. During this phase of
  such a predator-prey cycle, the core temperature rapidly increases while the edge
  temperature gradually decreases. The end of this reduced transport regime is governed
  by the onset of turbulence that governs large relaxation events, and a strong modification
  of the zonal flow pattern. '
