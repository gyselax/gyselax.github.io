abstract: 'A semi-Lagrangian code for the solution of the electrostatic drift-kinetic
  equations in straight cylinder configuration is presented. The code, CYGNE, is part
  of a project with the long term aim of studying microturbulence in fusion devices.
  The code has been constructed in such a way as to preserve a good control of the
  constants of motion, possessed by the drift-kinetic equations, until the nonlinear
  saturation of the ion-temperature-gradient modes occurs. Studies of convergence
  with phase space resolution and time-step are presented and discussed. The code
  is benchmarked against electrostatic Particle-in-Cell codes. '
