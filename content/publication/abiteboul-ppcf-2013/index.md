abstract: The turbulent transport of toroidal angular momentum in the core of a tokamak
  plasma is investigated in global, full- f gyrokinetic simulations, performed with
  the GYSELA code in the flux-driven regime. During the initial turbulent phase, a
  front of positive Reynolds stress propagates radially, generating intrinsic toroidal
  rotation from a vanishing initial profile. This is also accompanied by a propagating
  front of turbulent heat flux. In the statistical steady-state regime, turbulent
  transport exhibits large-scale avalanche-like events which are found to transport
  both heat and momentum, and similar statistical properties are obtained for both
  fluxes. The impact of scrape-off layer flows is also investigated by modifying the
  boundary conditions in the simulations. The observed impact is radially localized
  for L-mode like poloidal profiles of parallel velocity at the edge, while a constant
  velocity at the edge can modify the core toroidal rotation profile in a large fraction
  of the radial domain.
