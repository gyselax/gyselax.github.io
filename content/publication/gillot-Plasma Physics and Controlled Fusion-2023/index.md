abstract: "Abstract Reduced quasilinear and nonlinear (gradient-driven) models with\
  \ scale separations, commonly used to interpret experiments forecast turbulent transport\
  \ levels in magnetised plasmas, are tested against without separations (flux-driven).\
  \ Two distinct regimes of turbulence\u2014either above threshold or near marginal\
  \ stability\u2014are investigated Boltzmann electrons. The success reduced hinges\
  \ particular on the reproduction fluxes. Good agreement between is found threshold,\
  \ whilst significantly underpredict fluxes marginality, overlooking mesoscale flow\
  \ organisation turbulence self-advection. Constructive prescriptions whereby improve\
  \ discussed."
