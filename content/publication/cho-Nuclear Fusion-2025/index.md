abstract: Abstract We utilize the global full-F gyrokinetic code GYSELA to analyze
  nonlocal transport in presence of modulated heat source, period which is range a
  timescale. In submarginal stable case, it observed that localized and time-modulated
  source can trigger both diffusive avalanche-like transport. When source-stimulated
  occurs, propagation turbulence faster than pulse. addition, speed correlated with
  intensity source. This correlation also identified from analytic expression derived
  two-field critical gradient model.
