abstract: 'SOL turbulence is characterised by intermittent ballistic transport of
  density fronts. The interaction of such density structures with velocity shear layers
  is found to yield shearing effects over scales that are comparable to those of the
  fronts. Enhanced diffusion transport governed by the thinning of the radial extent
  of the density structure governs the decay of such a structure over a Dupree time.
  Velocity shear layers extending poloidally over a fraction of the poloidal wave
  length can also exhibit a stopping capability due to the collapse of the radial
  velocity within the shear layer. The penetration of the density structure within
  such a barrier is of the order of five hybrid Larmor radius. '
