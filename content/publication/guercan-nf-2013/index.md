abstract: Various indications on the weakly nonlocal character of turbulent plasma
  transport both from experimental fluctuation measurements from Tore Supra and observations
  from the full- f , flux-driven gyrokinetic code GYSELA are reported. A simple Fisher
  equation model of this weakly nonlocal dynamics can be formulated in terms of an
  evolution equation for the turbulent entropy density, which contains the basic phenomenon
  of radial turbulence spreading in addition to avalanche-like dynamics via coupling
  to profile modulations. A derivation of this model, which contains the so-called
  beach effect, a diffusive and convective flux components for the flux of turbulence
  intensity, in addition to linear group propagation is given, starting from the drift-kinetic
  equation. The proposed model has the form of a transport equation for turbulence
  intensity, and may be considered as an addition to transport modelling. The kinetic
  fluxes given, can be computed using model closures, or local gyrokinetics. The model
  is also used in a particular setup that represents the near edge region as a relatively
  stable zone between the core and edge region where the energy injection is locally
  more substantial. It is observed that with constant, physical coefficients, the
  model gives a convincing qualitative profile of fluctuation intensity when the turbulence
  is coming from the core region with either a group velocity or a convective flux.
