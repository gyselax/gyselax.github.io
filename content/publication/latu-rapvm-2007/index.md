abstract: This paper describes a parallel implementation of a numerical solver for
  the Vlasov equation. The solver is based on a kinetic model describing the motion
  of charged particles in a plasma. The evolution of the distribution of particles
  in phase space is computed with an explicit method, and we take into account the
  self-consistent electric field through the coupling with a Poisson type equation.
  In this paper, we focus on a recently developed 5D parallel numerical application
  dedicated to gyrokinetic simulation of tokamak systems and ITG turbulence simulation.
  A semi-Lagrangian Vlasov solver is used. A specific cubic spline interpolation allows
  us to formulate a domain decomposition method. A hybrid MPI/OpenMP paradigm was
  used to benefit from a large number of processors while reducing communication costs.
