abstract: "Abstract The effects of transport barriers on impurity transport, specifically\
  \ helium (He) and tungsten (W), are investigated using the global, flux-driven,\
  \ full-F, 5D gyrokinetic code GYSELA. barrier is induced by triggering E\xD7B shear\
  \ via an external poloidal momentum source, thereby stabilizing ITG turbulence reducing\
  \ outward heat fluxes. These reductions in particle fluxes due to lead enhanced\
  \ confinement, steepening ion temperature profiles diffusivity main species (i.e.\
  \ deuterium). Impurity both turbulent neoclassical regimes under various conditions,\
  \ with without barrier, along a reversed density profile for tungsten. found reduce\
  \ enhance thermal screening steepened profile. However, it also prevents from being\
  \ flushed out, increased inward Banana-Plateau (BP) flux, caused asymmetry source.\
  \ Overall, proves be effective mechanism not only but controlling transport."
