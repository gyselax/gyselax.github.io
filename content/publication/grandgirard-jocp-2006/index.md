abstract: 'A new code is presented here, named Gyrokinetic SEmi-LAgragian (GYSELA)
  code, which solves 4D drift-kinetic equations for ion temperature gradient driven
  turbulence in a cylinder (r;θ;z). The code validation is performed with the slab
  ITG mode that only depends on the parallel velocity. This code uses a semi-Lagrangian
  numerical scheme, which exhibits good properties of energy conservation in non-linear
  regime as well as an accurate description of fine spatial scales. The code has been
  validated in the linear and non-linear regimes. The GYSELA code is found to be stable
  over long simulation times (more than 20 times the linear growth rate of the most
  unstable mode), including for cases with a high resolution mesh. '
