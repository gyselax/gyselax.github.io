abstract: Poloidal asymmetries of the E × B plasma flow are known to play a role in
  neoclassical transport. One obvious reason is that an asymmetrical potential can
  produce a flux across the magnetic field. Also the associated distribution function
  may correlate with the magnetic drift velocity to enhance the neoclassical flux.
  Finally, poloidal variations of the electric potential can produce poloidal asymmetries
  of an impurity density, which in turn may modify the neoclassical transport coefficients.
  According to conventional neoclassical theory, the level of poloidal asymmetry of
  the electric potential is expected to be very small. Poloidal flow asymmetries can
  be driven by small scale turbulence via nonlinear coupling, and therefore change
  this result. In the present work, a general framework for the generation of axisymmetric
  structures of potential by turbulence is presented. Zonal flows, geodesic acoustic
  modes and convective cells are described by a single model. This is done by solving
  the gyrokinetic equation coupled to the quasi-neutrality equation. This calculation
  provides a predictive calculation of the frequency spectrum of flows given a specified
  forcing due to turbulence. It also shows that the dominant mechanism comes from
  zonal flow compression at intermediate frequencies, while ballooning of the turbulence
  Reynolds stress appears to be the main drive at low frequency.
