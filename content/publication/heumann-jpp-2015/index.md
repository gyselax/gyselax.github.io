abstract: " ABSTRACT We present a comprehensive survey of various computational methods\
  \ in CEDRES++ (Couplage Equilibre Diffusion Résistive pour l'Etude des Scénarios)\
  \ for finding equilibria of toroidal plasma. Our focus is on free-boundary plasma\
  \ equilibria, where either poloidal field coil currents or the temporal evolution\
  \ of voltages in poloidal field circuit systems are given data. Centered around\
  \ a piecewise linear finite element representation of the poloidal flux map, our\
  \ approach allows in large parts the use of established numerical schemes. The coupling\
  \ of a finite element method and a boundary element method gives consistent numerical\
  \ solutions for equilibrium problems in unbounded domains. We formulate a new Newton\
  \ method for the discretized nonlinear problem to tackle the various nonlinearities,\
  \ including the free plasma boundary. The Newton method guarantees fast convergence\
  \ and is the main building block for the inverse equilibrium problems that we can\
  \ handle in CEDRES++ as well. The inverse problems aim at finding either poloidal\
  \ field coil currents that ensure a desired shape and position of the plasma or\
  \ at finding the evolution of the voltages in the poloidal field circuit systems\
  \ that ensure a prescribed evolution of the plasma shape and position. We provide\
  \ equilibrium simulations for the tokamaks ITER and WEST to illustrate the performance\
  \ of CEDRES++ and its application areas. "
