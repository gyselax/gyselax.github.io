abstract: Poloidal asymmetries of impurities are commonly observed experimentally.
  Density asymmetry is already known to impact significantly the neoclassical prediction
  impurity fluxes. In this article, effect pressure and anisotropy on flux derived
  analytically. This compared with simulations performed gyrokinetic code GYSELA,
  featuring both turbulent transports. A fair agreement found between analytical result
  simulation. On special cases which considered, effects shown play a prominent role
  in modification transport.
