abstract: Ion Temperature Gradient driven turbulence is investigated with the global
  full- f gyrokinetic code GYSELA for different magnetic equilibria. Reversed shear
  and monotonous q profile cases do not exhibit dramatic changes nor in the dynamics
  nor in the level of turbulence, leading to similar mean profiles. Especially, no
  transport barrier is observed in the vicinity of s = 0 in the general case, although
  the radial extent of the gap without resonant modes is larger than the typical turbulence
  correlation length. Conversely, a transport barrier is found to develop in the gap
  region if non resonant modes are artificially suppressed from the simulation. Such
  simulations tend to reconcile previously published contradictory results, while
  extending the analysis to more realistic flux-driven gyrokinetic regimes.
