abstract: Global, heat flux-driven ITG gyrokinetic simulations which manifest the
  formation of macroscopic, mean toroidal flow profiles with peak thermal Mach number
  0.05, are reported. Both a particle-in-cell (XGC1p) and a semi-Lagrangian (GYSELA)
  approach are utilized without a priori assumptions of scale separation between turbulence
  and mean fields. Flux-driven ITG simulations with different edge flow boundary conditions
  show in both approaches the development of net unidirectional intrinsic rotation
  in the co-current direction. Intrinsic torque is shown to scale approximately linearly
  with the inverse scale length of the ion temperature gradient. External momentum
  input is shown to effectively cancel the intrinsic rotation profile, thus confirming
  the existence of a local residual stress and intrinsic torque. Fluctuation intensity,
  intrinsic torque and mean flow are demonstrated to develop inwards from the boundary.
  The measured correlations between residual stress and two fluctuation spectrum symmetry
  breakers, namely ExB shear and intensity gradient, are similar. Avalanches of (positive)
  heat flux, which propagate either outwards or inwards, are correlated with avalanches
  of (negative) parallel momentum flux, so that outward transport of heat and inward
  transport of parallel momentum are correlated and mediated by avalanches. The probability
  distribution functions of the outward heat flux and the inward momentum flux show
  strong structural similarity.
