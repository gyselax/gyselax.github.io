abstract: 'The issue of parallel flows asymmetries in the edge plasma is tackled with
  a new first principle transport and turbulence code. TOKAM-3D is a 3D full-torus
  fluid code that can be used both in diffusive and turbulent regimes and covers either
  exclusively closed flux surfaces or both open and closed field lines in limiter
  geometry. Two independent mechanisms susceptible to lead to large amplitude asymmetric
  parallel flows are evidenced. Global ExB drifts coupled with the presence of the
  limiter break the poloidal symmetry and can generate large amplitude parallel flows
  even with poloidally uniform transport coefficients. On the other hand, turbulent
  transport in the edge exhibits a strong ballooning of the radial particle flux generating
  an up-down structure on the parallel velocity. The combination of both mechanisms
  in complete simulations leads to a poloidal and radial distribution of the parallel
  velocity comparable to experimental results. '
