 abstract = {The issue of parallel flows asymmetries in the edge plasma is tackled with a new first principle transport and turbulence code. TOKAM-3D is a 3D full-torus fluid code that can be used both in diffusive and turbulent regimes and covers either exclusively closed flux surfaces or both open and closed field lines in limiter geometry. Two independent mechanisms susceptible to lead to large amplitude asymmetric parallel flows are evidenced. Global ExB drifts coupled with the presence of the limiter break the poloidal symmetry and can generate large amplitude parallel flows even with poloidally uniform transport coefficients. On the other hand, turbulent transport in the edge exhibits a strong ballooning of the radial particle flux generating an up-down structure on the parallel velocity. The combination of both mechanisms in complete simulations leads to a poloidal and radial distribution of the parallel velocity comparable to experimental results. },
