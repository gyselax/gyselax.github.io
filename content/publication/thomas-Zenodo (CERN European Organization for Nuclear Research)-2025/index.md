abstract: The Discrete Domain Computation (DDC) library is a C++ designed to provide
  high-performance, strongly-typed labelled multidimensional arrays. Inspired by Python's
  Xarray and built on top of performance-portable libraries like Kokkos, DDC enables
  expressive, safe, efficient numerical computations. It provides coherent ecosystem
  work with dimensions from data structures algorithms. Additionally, extends functionality
  through modules such as FFT (based kokkos-fft), splines, bridge the PDI library.
  actively used modernize legacy scientific codes, Fortran-based Gysela plasma simulation
  code.
