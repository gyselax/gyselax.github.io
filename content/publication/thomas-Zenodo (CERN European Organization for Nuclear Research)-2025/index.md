abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The Discrete Domain Computation (DDC) library is a C++ designed
  to provide high-performance, strongly-typed labelled multidimensional arrays. Inspired
  by Python''s Xarray and built on top of performance-portable libraries like Kokkos,
  DDC enables expressive, safe, efficient numerical computations. It provides coherent
  ecosystem work with dimensions from data structures algorithms. Additionally, extends
  functionality through modules such as FFT (based kokkos-fft), splines, bridge the
  PDI library. The actively used modernize legacy scientific codes, Fortran-based
  Gysela plasma simulation code.&lt;/p&gt;'
