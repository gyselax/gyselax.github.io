abstract: "In situ workflows are inescapable to fully leverage exascale architectures.\
  \ They can be complex build, however, because simulation and data analytics come\
  \ from two different software ecosystems with their own paradigms programming models.\
  \ This work extends the deisa bridging model between MPI+X simulations distributed\
  \ task-based analytics; it introduces concept of external tasks support description\
  \ graphs spanning multiple timesteps ahead time while improving scalability. new\
  \ approach leads a straightforward for contracts graph limit transferred that actually\
  \ analyzed in given execution. We implement this using Dask MPI evaluate an end-to-end\
  \ in-transit workflow uses unsupervised ML dimensionality reduction. compare our\
  \ plain postprocessing previous version deisa. Our performs better, up \xD7 7 3\
  \ compared deisa, is 18 less costly Dask\u2014all these similar development efforts."
