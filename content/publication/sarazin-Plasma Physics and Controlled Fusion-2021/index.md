abstract: "Abstract Reynolds stress is a key facet of turbulence self-organization.\
  \ In the magnetized plasmas controlled fusion devices, zonal flows that are driven\
  \ by averaged modify confinement performance. We address this problem with full-\
  \ f gyrokinetic simulations ion temperature gradient-driven turbulence. From detailed\
  \ analysis three-dimensional electric potential and transverse pressure fields,\
  \ we show diamagnetic contribution to stress\u2014stemming from finite Larmor radius\
  \ effects\u2014exceeds electrostatic factor about two. Both contributions in phase,\
  \ indicating does not behave as passive scalar. addition, induced drift velocity\
  \ found be mainly governed gradient phase modes rather than their magnitude. By\
  \ decoupling drive intensity, property indicates careful dynamics crucial interpretation\
