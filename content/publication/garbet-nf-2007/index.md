abstract: This paper presents the results obtained with a set of gyrokinetic codes
  based on a semi-Lagrangian scheme. Several physics issues are addressed, namely,
  the comparison between fluid and kinetic descriptions, the intermittent behaviour
  of flux driven turbulence and the role of large scale flows in toroidal ITG turbulence.
  The question of the initialization of full-F simulations is also discussed.
