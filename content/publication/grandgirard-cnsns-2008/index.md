abstract: 'This paper addresses non-linear global gyrokinetic simulations of ion temperature
  gradient (ITG) driven turbulence with the Gysela code. The particularity of Gysela
  code is to use a semi-Lagrangian (SL) scheme for the full distribution function.
  The 4D non-linear drift-kinetic version of the code already shows the interest in
  such a SL method which exhibits good properties of energy conservation. The code
  has been upgrated to run 5D toroidal simulations. Linear benchmarks and non-linear
  results are presented. '
