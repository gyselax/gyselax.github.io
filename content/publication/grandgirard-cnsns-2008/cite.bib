 abstract = {This paper addresses non-linear global gyrokinetic simulations of ion temperature gradient (ITG) driven turbulence with the Gysela code. The particularity of Gysela code is to use a semi-Lagrangian (SL) scheme for the full distribution function. The 4D non-linear drift-kinetic version of the code already shows the interest in such a SL method which exhibits good properties of energy conservation. The code has been upgrated to run 5D toroidal simulations. Linear benchmarks and non-linear results are presented. },
