abstract: 'Turbulence in the scrape-off layer (SOL) is investigated using a 2D fluid
  model for the interchange instability as a paradigm. A constant driving flux governs
  the dynamics of both the equilibrium and fluctuating parts of the density and electric
  potential. The turbulent flux exhibits intermittent bursts, called avalanches. These
  events account for a significant part of the total transport, and are manifested
  as poloidally localized density fingers, extending towards the far SOL. The time
  averaged density profile looks exponential, and the SOL width increases weakly with
  the driving source (scaling exponent 2/9). Viscosity is found to govern the characteristic
  radial size of convective cells, which in turn control the transport magnitude.
  The larger ν, the larger the turbulent transport. Finally, the impact on turbulence
  of local biasing is investigated, possibly modeling Langmuir probe measurements.
  For a too large extent of the theoretical probe, the density drops by factors at
  the probe, due to the local build up of a screening vortex. The ambient density
  is recovered for a sufficiently small probe. In this case, fluctuations exhibit
  a similar Fourier spectrum at and next to the probe, though the probe still misses
  a significant number of large bursts. Finally, the experimental probe characteristics
  are recovered qualitatively when varying the biasing potential. '
