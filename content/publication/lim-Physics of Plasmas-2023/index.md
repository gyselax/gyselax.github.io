abstract: "The effect of toroidal rotation on both turbulent and neoclassical transport\
  \ tungsten (W) in tokamaks is investigated using the flux-driven, global, nonlinear\
  \ 5D gyrokinetic code GYSELA. Nonlinear simulations are carried out with different\
  \ levels momentum injection that drive W into supersonic regime, while velocity\
  \ main ions remains subsonic regime. numerical demonstrate induces centrifugal forces\
  \ cause to accumulate outboard region, generating an in\u2013out poloidal asymmetry.\
  \ This asymmetry enhances inward convection, which can lead central accumulation\
  \ cases strong plasma rotation. core mainly driven by convection. However, as continues,\
  \ roto-diffusion, proportional radial gradient velocity, becomes significant generates\
  \ outward flux case ion temperature turbulence. Overall, results from GYSELA qualitative\
  \ agreement theoretical predictions for impurity transport."
