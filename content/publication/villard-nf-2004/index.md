abstract: The aim of this paper is to report on recent advances made in global gyrokinetic
  simulations of ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes and other microinstabilities.
  The nonlinear development and saturation of ITG modes and the role of E × B zonal
  flows are studied with a global nonlinear δ f formulation that retains parallel
  nonlinearity and thus allows for a check of the energy conservation property as
  a means of verifying the quality of the numerical simulation. Due to an optimized
  loading technique, the conservation property is satisfied with an unprecedented
  quality well into the nonlinear stage. The zonal component of the perturbation evolves
  to a quasi-steady state with regions of ITG suppression, strongly reduced radial
  energy flux and steepened effective temperature profiles alternating with regions
  of higher ITG mode amplitudes, larger radial energy flux and flattened effective
  temperature profiles. A semi-Lagrangian approach free of statistical noise is proposed
  as an alternative to the nonlinear δ f formulation. An ASDEX-Upgrade experiment
  with an internal transport barrier is analysed with a global gyrokinetic code that
  includes trapped electron dynamics. The weakly destabilizing effect of trapped electron
  dynamics on ITG modes in an axisymmetric bumpy configuration modelling W7-X is shown
  in global linear simulations that retain the full electron dynamics. Finite β effects
  on microinstabilities are investigated with a linear global spectral electromagnetic
  gyrokinetic formulation. The radial global structure of electromagnetic modes shows
  a resonant behaviour with rational q values.
