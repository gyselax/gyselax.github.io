abstract: In the nonlinear regime, the stability of resonantly driven systems, such
  as energetic particle driven modes in magnetically confined plasmas, is shown to
  depend on the presence and nature of an underlying damping mechanism. When resonant
  damping is involved, subcritical states can occur. In particular, purely nonlinear
  steady-state regimes can be postulated, whose destabilization threshold and saturation
  levels are calculated and validated using a reduced one-dimensional paradigmatic
  bump-on-tail model. The applicability of the developed model to realistic tokamak
  acoustic modes is assessed. It is shown that purely nonlinear steady-state regimes
  are possible under standard tokamak conditions.
