abstract: 'Non-linear gyrokinetic simulations of the interchange instability are discussed.
  The semi-Lagrangian numerical scheme allows one to address two critical points achieved
  with simulations lasting several confinement times: an accurate statistical analysis
  of the fluctuations and the back reaction of the turbulence on equilibrium profiles.
  Zonal flows are found to quench a 2D + 1D interchange turbulence when one of the
  species has a vanishing response to zonal modes. Conversely, when streamers dominate,
  the equilibrium profiles are found to be stiff. In the non-linear regime and steady-state
  turbulence, the distribution function exhibits a significant departure from a Maxwellian
  distribution. This property is characterized by an expansion on generalized Laguerre
  functions with a slow decay of the series of moments. This justifies the use of
  gyrokinetic simulations since a standard fluid approach, based on a limited number
  of moments, would certainly require a complex closure so as to take into account
  the impact of these non-vanishing high order moments.'
