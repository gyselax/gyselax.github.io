abstract: Flux-driven global gyrokinetic codes are now mature enough to make predictions
  in terms of turbulence and transport in tokamak plasmas. Some of the recent breakthroughs
  of three such codes, namely GYSELA, ORB5 and XGC1, are reported and compared wherever
  appropriate. In all three codes, turbulent transport appears to be mediated by avalanche-like
  events, for a broad range of ρ * = ρ i / a values, ratio of the gyro-radius over
  the minor radius. Still, the radial correlation length scales with ρ i , leading
  to the gyro-Bohm scaling of the effective transport coefficient below ρ * ≈ 1/300.
  The possible explanation could be due to the fact that avalanches remain meso-scale
  due to the interaction with zonal flows, whose characteristic radial wavelength
  appears to be almost independent of the system size. As a result of the radial corrugation
  of the turbulence driven zonal and mean flows, the shear of the radial electric
  field can be significantly underestimated if poloidal rotation is assumed to be
  governed by the neoclassical theory, especially at low collisionality. Indeed, the
  turbulence contribution to the poloidal rotation increases when collisionality decreases.
  Finally, the numerical verification of toroidal momentum balance shows that both
  neoclassical and turbulent contributions to the Reynolds' stress tensor play the
  dominant role. The phase space analysis further reveals that barely passing supra-thermal
  particles mostly contribute to the toroidal flow generation, consistently with quasi-linear
  predictions.
