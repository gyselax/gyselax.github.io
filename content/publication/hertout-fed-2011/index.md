abstract: 'Free-boundary equilibrium codes are an essential tool for tokamak design
  studies and scenario development. In this contribution, the CEDRES++ code is presented
  and applications to ITER, JT-60SA and Tore Supra are reported on. A satisfactory
  benchmark of CEDRES++ with the DINA code was performed on an ITER Scenario 2 case
  at 32 different times across the discharge, both in direct and inverse mode. Ongoing
  design studies for the poloidal field coils system of JT-60SA, performed in the
  frame of the Broader Approach, were cross-checked with CEDRES++. Finally, a dimensioning
  study was carried out for the coils and power supplies for plasma vertical control
  in the frame of a feasibility study for the implementation of a divertor in Tore
  Supra. '
