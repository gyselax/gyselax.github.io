 abstract = {Free-boundary equilibrium codes are an essential tool for tokamak design studies and scenario development. In this contribution, the CEDRES++ code is presented and applications to ITER, JT-60SA and Tore Supra are reported on. A satisfactory benchmark of CEDRES++ with the \DINA\ code was performed on an \ITER\ Scenario 2 case at 32 different times across the discharge, both in direct and inverse mode. Ongoing design studies for the poloidal field coils system of JT-60SA, performed in the frame of the Broader Approach, were cross-checked with CEDRES++. Finally, a dimensioning study was carried out for the coils and power supplies for plasma vertical control in the frame of a feasibility study for the implementation of a divertor in Tore Supra. },
