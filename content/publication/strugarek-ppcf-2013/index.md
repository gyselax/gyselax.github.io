abstract: The creation of ion transport barriers by externally induced sheared E Ã—
  B flows is investigated with the global, full-f and flux-driven gyrokinetic code
  GYSELA. A gyrokinetic source of vorticity is designed and proves to be efficient
  in polarizing the plasma. Induced sheared electric fields develop in the turbulent
  core and are accompanied by the creation of a transport barrier. The barrier and
  the sheared flow relax quasi-periodically because of zonal flow activity and a destabilizing
  temperature anisotropy induced by the vorticity source. A new cyclic mechanism leading
  to the relaxation of transport barriers in tokamaks is discovered.
