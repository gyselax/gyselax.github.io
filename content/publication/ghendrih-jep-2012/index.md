abstract: Edge plasma turbulence modelled with 2D interchange is shown to exhibit
  convective transport at the microscale level. This transport property is related
  to avalanche like transport in such a flux-driven system. Correlation functions
  and source modulation are used to analyse the transport properties but do not allow
  one to recover the Fick law that must characterise the system at large scales. Coarse
  graining is then introduced to average out the small scales in order to recover
  the Fick law. One finds that the required space averaging is comparable to the system
  size while the time averaging is comparable to the confinement time. The system
  is then reduced to a single reservoir such that transport is characterised by a
  single scalar, either the diffusion coefficient of the Fick law or a characteristic
  evolution time constant.
