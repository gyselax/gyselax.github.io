abstract: The turbulent transport governed by the toroidal ion temperature gradient
  driven instability is analysed with the full- f global gyrokinetic code GYSELA (Grandgirard
  et al 2007 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion [/0741-3335/49/12b/s16] 49 B173 ) when the
  system is driven by a prescribed heat source. Weak, yet finite, collisionality governs
  a neoclassical ion heat flux that can compete with the turbulent driven transport.
  In turn, the ratio of turbulent to neoclassical transport increases with the source
  magnitude, resulting in the degradation of confinement with additional power. The
  turbulent flux exhibits avalanche-like events, characterized by intermittent outbursts
  which propagate ballistically roughly at the diamagnetic velocity. Locally, the
  temperature gradient can drop well below the linear stability threshold. Large outbursts
  are found to correlate with streamer-like structures of the convection cells albeit
  their Fourier spectrum departs significantly from that of the most unstable linear
  modes. Last, the poloidal rotation of turbulent eddies is essentially governed by
  the radial electric field at moderate density gradient.
