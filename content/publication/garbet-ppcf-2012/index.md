abstract: A variational principle based on the calculation of the entropy production
  rate is derived, which covers particle, momentum and heat transport. This principle
  is used to define proper thermodynamical forces and fluxes. When turbulent parallel
  wavenumbers are small, and fluctuations are ballooned, it is found that the forces
  are the gradients of density, velocity and temperature normalized to canonical profiles,
  which are power laws of the magnetic field. The transport matrix is symmetrical
  for a given background of fluctuations, i.e. if the dependence of the turbulence
  intensity on gradients is ignored. Minimization of the entropy production rate implies
  that the profiles tend to relax towards their canonical values, though these values
  are never reached simultaneously since they are linearly stable. Also it turns out
  that parallel and perpendicular canonical temperatures are not the same, so that
  the equilibrium distribution function relaxes towards a two-temperature Maxwellian.
  When finite turbulence parallel wavenumbers are accounted for, residual fluxes appear.
  Forces can be redefined to preserve Onsager symmetry but residual heat and momentum
  sources remain, which correspond to turbulent heating and momentum transfer.
