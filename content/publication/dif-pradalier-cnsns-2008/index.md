abstract: 'This paper tackles the delicate choice of the initial distribution function
  in full-f gyrokinetic codes such as Gysela 5d, aiming at predicting the turbulent
  transport level in low collisional tokamak plasmas. It is found, both analytically
  and numerically, that a Maxwellian distribution function with constant profiles
  on magnetic flux surfaces leads to the fast generation of a large scale electric
  field. Such a field opposes the up–down charge separation governed by the inhomogeneity
  of the equilibrium magnetic field. If large enough, the shearing rate induced by
  the resulting poloidal ExB velocity could efficiently reduce the plasma micro-instabilities
  which account for the development of the turbulence. Starting in the ab initio code
  Gysela 5d from an equilibrium distribution function depending on motion invariants
  only is shown to cure such a problem. In this case, charge separation is counter-balanced
  by parallel flow, and the standard fluid force balance is recovered. '
