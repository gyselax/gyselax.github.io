abstract: A penalization technique is applied in global and flux driven gyrokinetic
  simulations to model a limiter configuration. The immersed boundary implemented
  terms of restoring force cold distribution function. It acts as perfect heat absorber.
  Parallel kinetic propagation front generated by the tested with 1-D 1-V single species
  model. An analytical expression derived describe initial transient density, particle
  energy profiles, induced ballistic phase space(x, v). same recovered code on function
  along poloidal direction. velocity measured matches theoretical prediction.
