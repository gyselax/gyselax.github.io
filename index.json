One obvious reason is that an asymmetrical potential can produce a flux across the magnetic field. Also the associated distribution function may correlate with the magnetic drift velocity to enhance the neoclassical flux. Finally, poloidal variations of the electric potential can produce poloidal asymmetries of an impurity density, which in turn may modify the neoclassical transport coefficients. According to conventional neoclassical theory, the level of poloidal asymmetry of the electric potential is expected to be very small. Poloidal flow asymmetries can be driven by small scale turbulence via nonlinear coupling, and therefore change this result. In the present work, a general framework for the generation of axisymmetric structures of potential by turbulence is presented. Zonal flows, geodesic acoustic modes and convective cells are described by a single model. This is done by solving the gyrokinetic equation coupled to the quasi-neutrality equation. This calculation provides a predictive calculation of the frequency spectrum of flows given a specified forcing due to turbulence. It also shows that the dominant mechanism comes from zonal flow compression at intermediate frequencies, while ballooning of the turbulence Reynolds stress appears to be the main drive at low frequency.","tags":[],"title":"Turbulent generation of poloidal asymmetries of the electric potential in a tokamak","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

Grandgirard et al., emphComp. Phys. Commun. bf 207, 35 (2016)]. A reduced and linearized multi-species collision operator has been recently implemented, so that both neoclassical and turbulent transport channels can be treated self-consistently on an equal footing. In the Pfirsch-Schlüter regime likely relevant for tungsten, the standard expression of the neoclassical impurity flux is shown to be recovered from gyrokinetics with the employed collision operator. Purely neoclassical simulations of deuterium plasma with trace impurities of helium, carbon and tungsten lead to impurity diffusion coefficients, inward pinch velocities due to density peaking, and thermo-diffusion terms which quantitatively agree with neoclassical predictions and NEO simulations [E. Belli et al., emphPlasma Phys. Control. Fusion textbf54, 015015 (2012)]. The thermal screening factor appears to be less than predicted analytically in the Pfirsch-Schlẗer regime, which can be detrimental to fusion performance. Finally, self-consistent nonlinear simulations have revealed that the tungsten impurity flux is not the sum of turbulent and neoclassical fluxes computed separately, as usually assumed. The synergy partly results from the turbulence-driven in-out poloidal asymmetry of tungsten density. This result puts forward the need for self-consistent simulations of impurity transport, i.e. including both turbulence and neoclassical physics, in view of quantitative predictions for ITER.","tags":[],"title":"Self-consistent gyrokinetic modeling of neoclassical and turbulent impurity transport","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Firstly, the excitation of electrostatic instabilities in linear gyrokinetic simulations performed with the global GYSELA code by introducing distribution functions typical of fast ions in tokamak plasmas is presented. The obtained mode is unambiguously characterized as an EGAM, i.e. a geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) excited by EPs. The influence of EGAMs on turbulence and associated transport is then analyzed by implementing a source adapted to the inclusion of fast particle populations in non-linear simulations. This source successfully excites EGAMs in the presence of turbulence, which leads to a drastic reduction of the turbulent transport. However, this reduction is only transient; it is followed by an increase of the turbulent activity, characterized by a complex interaction between the EGAMs and the turbulence. In the subsequent steady-state regime, turbulent transport appears to be modulated at the EGAM frequency.","tags":[],"title":"Interplay between fast ions and turbulence in magnetic fusion plasmas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

A simple Fisher equation model of this weakly nonlocal dynamics can be formulated in terms of an evolution equation for the turbulent entropy density, which contains the basic phenomenon of radial turbulence spreading in addition to avalanche-like dynamics via coupling to profile modulations. A derivation of this model, which contains the so-called beach effect, a diffusive and convective flux components for the flux of turbulence intensity, in addition to linear group propagation is given, starting from the drift-kinetic equation. The proposed model has the form of a transport equation for turbulence intensity, and may be considered as an addition to transport modelling. The kinetic fluxes given, can be computed using model closures, or local gyrokinetics. The model is also used in a particular setup that represents the near edge region as a relatively stable zone between the core and edge region where the energy injection is locally more substantial. It is observed that with constant, physical coefficients, the model gives a convincing qualitative profile of fluctuation intensity when the turbulence is coming from the core region with either a group velocity or a convective flux.","tags":[],"title":"Structure of nonlocality of plasma turbulence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.

Both a particle-in-cell (XGC1p) and a semi-Lagrangian (GYSELA) approach are utilized without a priori assumptions of scale separation between turbulence and mean fields. Flux-driven ITG simulations with different edge flow boundary conditions show in both approaches the development of net unidirectional intrinsic rotation in the co-current direction. Intrinsic torque is shown to scale approximately linearly with the inverse scale length of the ion temperature gradient. External momentum input is shown to effectively cancel the intrinsic rotation profile, thus confirming the existence of a local residual stress and intrinsic torque. Fluctuation intensity, intrinsic torque and mean flow are demonstrated to develop inwards from the boundary. The measured correlations between residual stress and two fluctuation spectrum symmetry breakers, namely ExB shear and intensity gradient, are similar. Avalanches of (positive) heat flux, which propagate either outwards or inwards, are correlated with avalanches of (negative) parallel momentum flux, so that outward transport of heat and inward transport of parallel momentum are correlated and mediated by avalanches.

This principle is used to define proper thermodynamical forces and fluxes. When turbulent parallel wavenumbers are small, and fluctuations are ballooned, it is found that the forces are the gradients of density, velocity and temperature normalized to canonical profiles, which are power laws of the magnetic field. The transport matrix is symmetrical for a given background of fluctuations, i.e. if the dependence of the turbulence intensity on gradients is ignored. Minimization of the entropy production rate implies that the profiles tend to relax towards their canonical values, though these values are never reached simultaneously since they are linearly stable. Also it turns out that parallel and perpendicular canonical temperatures are not the same, so that the equilibrium distribution function relaxes towards a two-temperature Maxwellian. When finite turbulence parallel wavenumbers are accounted for, residual fluxes appear. Forces can be redefined to preserve Onsager symmetry but residual heat and momentum sources remain, which correspond to turbulent heating and momentum transfer.","tags":[],"title":"Thermodynamics of neoclassical and turbulent transport","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J-Ph.

Some of the recent breakthroughs of three such codes, namely GYSELA, ORB5 and XGC1, are reported and compared wherever appropriate. In all three codes, turbulent transport appears to be mediated by avalanche-like events, for a broad range of ρ * = ρ i / a values, ratio of the gyro-radius over the minor radius. Still, the radial correlation length scales with ρ i , leading to the gyro-Bohm scaling of the effective transport coefficient below ρ * ≈ 1/300. The possible explanation could be due to the fact that avalanches remain meso-scale due to the interaction with zonal flows, whose characteristic radial wavelength appears to be almost independent of the system size. As a result of the radial corrugation of the turbulence driven zonal and mean flows, the shear of the radial electric field can be significantly underestimated if poloidal rotation is assumed to be governed by the neoclassical theory, especially at low collisionality. Indeed, the turbulence contribution to the poloidal rotation increases when collisionality decreases. Finally, the numerical verification of toroidal momentum balance shows that both neoclassical and turbulent contributions to the Reynolds' stress tensor play the dominant role. The phase space analysis further reveals that barely passing supra-thermal particles mostly contribute to the toroidal flow generation, consistently with quasi-linear predictions.","tags":[],"title":"Predictions on heat transport and plasma rotation from global gyrokinetic simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

This paper presents some of the main recent advances in gyrokinetic theory and computing of turbulence. Solving 5D gyrokinetic equations for each species requires state-of-the-art high performance computing techniques involving massively parallel computers and parallel scalable algorithms. The various numerical schemes that have been explored until now, Lagrangian, Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian, each have their advantages and drawbacks. A past controversy regarding the finite size effect (finite ρ* ) in ITG turbulence has now been resolved. It has triggered an intensive benchmarking effort and careful examination of the convergence properties of the different numerical approaches. Now, both Eulerian and Lagrangian global codes are shown to agree and to converge to the flux-tube result in the ρ*-0 limit. It is found, however, that an appropriate treatment of geometrical terms is necessary: inconsistent approximations that are sometimes used can lead to important discrepancies. Turbulent processes are characterized by a chaotic behaviour, often accompanied by bursts and avalanches. Performing ensemble averages of statistically independent simulations, starting from different initial conditions, is presented as a way to assess the intrinsic variability of turbulent fluxes and obtain reliable estimates of the standard deviation. Further developments concerning non-adiabatic electron dynamics around mode-rational surfaces and electromagnetic effects are discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Gyrokinetic simulations of turbulent transport: size scaling and chaotic behaviour","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

Zonal flows are found to lead to a non-linear upshift of turbulent transport in a 3D kinetic model for interchange turbulence. Such a transition is absent from fluid simulations, performed with the same numerical tool, which also predict a much larger transport. The discrepancy cannot be explained by zonal flows only, despite they being overdamped in fluids. Indeed, some difference remains, although reduced, when they are artificially suppressed. Zonal flows are also reported to trigger transport barriers in a 4D drift-kinetic model for slab ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence. The density gradient acts as a source drive for zonal flows, while their curvature back stabilizes the turbulence. Finally, 5D simulations of toroidal ITG modes with the global and full- f GYSELA code require the equilibrium density function to depend on the motion invariants only. If not, the generated strong mean flows can completely quench turbulent transport.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of large scale flows on turbulent transport","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

The semi-Lagrangian numerical scheme allows one to address two critical points achieved with simulations lasting several confinement times: an accurate statistical analysis of the fluctuations and the back reaction of the turbulence on equilibrium profiles. Zonal flows are found to quench a 2D + 1D interchange turbulence when one of the species has a vanishing response to zonal modes. Conversely, when streamers dominate, the equilibrium profiles are found to be stiff. In the non-linear regime and steady-state turbulence, the distribution function exhibits a significant departure from a Maxwellian distribution. This property is characterized by an expansion on generalized Laguerre functions with a slow decay of the series of moments. This justifies the use of gyrokinetic simulations since a standard fluid approach, based on a limited number of moments, would certainly require a complex closure so as to take into account the impact of these non-vanishing high order moments.","tags":[],"title":"Kinetic features of interchange turbulence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

A constant driving flux governs the dynamics of both the equilibrium and fluctuating parts of the density and electric potential. The turbulent flux exhibits intermittent bursts, called avalanches. These events account for a significant part of the total transport, and are manifested as poloidally localized density fingers, extending towards the far SOL. The time averaged density profile looks exponential, and the SOL width increases weakly with the driving source (scaling exponent 2/9). Viscosity is found to govern the characteristic radial size of convective cells, which in turn control the transport magnitude. The larger ν, the larger the turbulent transport. Finally, the impact on turbulence of local biasing is investigated, possibly modeling Langmuir probe measurements. For a too large extent of the theoretical probe, the density drops by factors at the probe, due to the local build up of a screening vortex. The ambient density is recovered for a sufficiently small probe. In this case, fluctuations exhibit a similar Fourier spectrum at and next to the probe, though the probe still misses a significant number of large bursts. Finally, the experimental probe characteristics are recovered qualitatively when varying the biasing potential.
